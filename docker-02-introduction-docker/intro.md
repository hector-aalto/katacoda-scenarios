## Introduction to Docker 

**Objective:** An overview of Docker’s functionality working with containers<br>

**Preparation:** Open up two instances of your favorite shell, and a browser window<br>

**Outcome:** Each participant will replicate a highlight demo of some basic functionality<br>

**Data Files:** No data needed.<br>

As we are learning, Docker is a container technology. When we talk about Docker, we are talking about containers. Remember, containers are spun up off of images, and images and spun up off of Dockerfiles. We will talk more about creating an image from a Dockerfile later, but for now let’s grab an existing image on Docker Hub and run a container.
